My first attempt to write a BBD test case.

tutorial: taken from behave's tutorial

wiki: Got from Ulf

The tests will be started with:

$ behave [-v]

$ behave --no-capture     # To have stdout in console

Used pep8  (no errors/warning)

pylint   (main issue, missing docstring and same name of functions i.e stepl_impl)
